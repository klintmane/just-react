I love programming, donâ€™t want to go to work, pay attention to my official account, can gain:

-In-depth original **video** and **article** of the `React` technology stack

-What did I do not to go to work, maybe you can learn from it too

-Pull you into the `Human high-quality front-end framework exchange group` and communicate with friends on all aspects of the framework
